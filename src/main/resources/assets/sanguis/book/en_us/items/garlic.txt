Garlic may be found either as wild garlic on fields and windswept hills or grown in Hunter Camps.
Some garlic may also be stored in Pillager Outposts or Villages, should one be ready to steal from them.

Garlic can be used for Garlic Injections and to halt (and eventually reverse) a vampiric infection.

Garlic can also be planted just like Carrots or Potatoes, dropping more Garlic and some Garlic Flowers when fully grown.

Garlic Flowers are mostly used for Garlic Strings, which act as a Vampire repellent.
