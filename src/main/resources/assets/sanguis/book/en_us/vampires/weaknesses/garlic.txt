Vampires also have an intense hatred for garlic, as they crumble when so much as near to it.

Any vampire near Garlic Flowers or a Garlic Crop will be much slower and weaker than usual.

This is often used by Vampire Hunters; They like to lure out Vampires with strings of Garlic Flowers and decorate their camps with them.


As such, it is usually not wise to approach these camps as a Vampire, as this will make fighting the hunters almost entirely impossible.
