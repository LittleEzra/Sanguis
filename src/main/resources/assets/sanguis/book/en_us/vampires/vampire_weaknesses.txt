For every strength a vampire has, they also have a weakness.

Many of these can be considered common knowledge, such as a vampire's reaction to sunlight.

Any vampire in direct sunlight will combust instantaneously. This can be avoided by using fire resistance or simply not going outside when it is sunny.

This will also stop a vampire from transforming into a bat.

Vampires also have an intense disdain for garlic, which cripples them by simply being near it.
This is often used by vampire hunters, which decorate their camps with strung garlic flowers and grow garlic themselves.
