Vampires and bats are very closely related. In fact, it is theorized that vampirism originates from a kind of "Ur-bat", which some believe is still alive today.
This relationship is obvious with a vampire's ability to turn into a bat.

A vampire can turn into a bat at will (by pressing the appropriate key), though only when not in sunlight and not too hurt.

As a bat, a vampire will be able to move freely through the air, but at a much higher blood cost, which is increased even further when sprinting.

Bats are also much weaker than a humanoid vampire, with half the health and without the ability to attack.
