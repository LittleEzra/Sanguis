Passing the night will do a Vampire little good - it would be far more convenient to skip the day, instead.
For this, a coffin will be required.

A coffin can be made with six planks filling the bottom and top rows and three wool filling the middle row.

They work exactly like beds, except that they skip the day instead of night and can only be used by vampires.
They come in the usual 16 colors, though the wood is always oak.
