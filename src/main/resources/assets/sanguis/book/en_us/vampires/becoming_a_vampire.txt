To become a Vampire, you must be either bitten by a Vampire from behind, or pierce yourself with one of their fangs (Sneak + Use).
This will start the incubation progress, which usually takes around 10 minutes when bitten or 5 when doing it manually.

Should this not be desired, eating Garlic can delay the transformation, and after eating enough (roughly 5 bulbs) stop it entirely.



For the transformation, it is wise not to be in the sun as it happens, since a Vampire will instantly combust when touching sunlight.
Due to this, you will be relegated to the darkness of night after being transformed.
You may choose to take refuge in a cave or a structure of your own to avoid the sun.


Vampires have many weaknesses and strengths, which will be explained and detailed in the following chapters.
