As is relatively well known, Vampires burst into flames in sunlight.
Sunlight also stops a Vampire from transforming into a bat.

For a less monstrous Vampire, there are some ways to circumvent this.
Naturally, you could simply not go outside during the day, or spend this time in a coffin¹.

However, should you ever need to go outside during the day, you can craft a simple Parasol with Black Wool, Iron Ingots, and two Bat Wings.

When held, this will make you immune to sunlight, though you will have trouble fighting or feeding while holding it.
