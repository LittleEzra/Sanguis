Should one have become a Vampire and want to return to being a human, one will first need Garlic.

This will naturally be difficult to collect, since Garlic weakens Vampires and is usually defended.
Villages are often safer than hunter camps, since in a village only the Iron Golem is of concern.

By combining a Syringe, three Garlic, and a Golden Apple, a Garlic Injection can be made.
This injection will cure vampirism (as well as being necessary to become a Vampire Hunter¹).
Simply inject it by sneaking and using it.
