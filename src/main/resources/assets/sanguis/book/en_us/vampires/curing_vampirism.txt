Should one have become a vampire and want to return to being a human, one will first need garlic.

This will naturally be difficult to collect, since garlic weakens vampires and is usually defended.
Villages are often safer than hunter camps, since in a village only the iron golem is of concern.

By combining a syringe, three garlic, and a golden apple, a garlic injection can be made.
This injection will cure vampirism (as well as being necessary to become a vampire hunter).
Simply inject it by sneaking and using it.
