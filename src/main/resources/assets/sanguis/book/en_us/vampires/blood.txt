As a vampire, you will no longer be able to eat normal food like bread or apples, but will instead have to survive off of the blood of living creatures.

You can drain a creature using "V" by default.
Only certain creatures can be drained, however, with Villagers having the most blood.

Unlike food, blood only drops with time, and not when doing exhausting things like running or jumping.
However, as a Bat the hunger drain will be increased, as well as costing a blood drop to transform.
