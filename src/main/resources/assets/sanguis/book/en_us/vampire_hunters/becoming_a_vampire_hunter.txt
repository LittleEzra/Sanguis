The Vampire Hunters are a guild of Villagers dedicated to eradicating Vampires.
For many, it seems appealing to join them, as they are rather celebrated by civilians.

But to become a Vampire Hunter, you must first be vaccinated against vampirism.

This is done by using a "Garlic Injection", made with a Syringe, three Garlic, and a Golden Apple.

Once this is injected, it immunizes against vampirism, turning you into a proper Vampire Hunter.
