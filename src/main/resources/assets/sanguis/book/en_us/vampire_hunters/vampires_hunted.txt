Vampires, unlike most monsters, cannot spawn underground. They are mostly found in forests at night, in particular preferring Dark Forests.

As a hunter, you have many items at your disposal to make it easier to fight them.

Stakes are a classic tool for killing vampires. It can instantly kill them when already weakened (to about 25% of their max health).


When doing so, you will also obtain a bottle of Vampire Blood.

Cleavers are also commonly used. Made with steel and garlic, they are much more effective against vampires than anything else.

Many hunters also choose to use a Crossbow with special Golden Quarrels, which are also very effective against vampires.
