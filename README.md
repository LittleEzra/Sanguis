Sanguis adds Vampires to the game, either for you to hunt them down or join them.

This mod is heavily inspired by <a href="https://modrinth.com/mod/vampirism">Vampirism</a>, and takes many concepts from it, though it still represents my own take on a vampire mod.

<h2>Guide</h2>
The mod includes an in-game guide book called "Daemonologie", crafted with a Bloody Fang (dropped by Vampire entities) or Garlic and a Book.
